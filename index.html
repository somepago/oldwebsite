  Hi! Welcome to my website. I am Gowthami (I'm sure you know this by now!). I am currently a Master's student at University of Maryland, College Park.
  I am part of CML and CBCB at UMD. Before I started my Masters, I have worked for 8 years in industry at various capacities, as Engineer, Developer and Manager in diverse fields of Automobile, Oil & Gas, Fashion and E-commerce.
