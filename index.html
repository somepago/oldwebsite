  Hi! Welcome to my website. I am Gowthami (I'm sure you know this by now!). I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park.
  I am part of Center for Machine Learning and CBCB at UMD. Before I started my MS, I have worked for 8 years in industry at various capacities, as Engineer, Developer and Manager in diverse fields of Automobile, Oil & Gas, Fashion and E-commerce.
  In another lifetime (10 years this May), I graduated with a Dual-Degree (Bachelors and Masters) in Mechanical Engineering and Product Design from IIT Madras.

   I am interested in Machine Learning and it's applications in Computational Biology.
